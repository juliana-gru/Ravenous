Web app that searches the Yelp API for businesses, which include restaurants and points of interest.

Built with ReactJS. Live on: https://juliana-gru.github.io/RavenousWebApp/

This project is one of many built for Codecademy's course "Create a Front-end app with React". 

Some additional features added by myself:
-Pressing the enter key triggers a search
-Show a 'loading' message while waiting for results from the API
-Refresh the search when choosing a different "Sort By" option
